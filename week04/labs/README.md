### This lab will follow on from the homework and build a 1d-CNN

#### Colab version   
       
Let's go to the lab at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119a6K6r_aRNccyMdIaSInhXTmaLPDD2N?usp=sharing).
     
You can run through all the steps; and see how the model is build up on the Coversational AI dataset.   
At the end you need to load pretrained embeddings from Stanford's GloVe project. Note, 
there is a step to download these embeddings in the book.   

#### Nvidia NX Version    
   
To be continued.
