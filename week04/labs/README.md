### This lab will follow on from the homework and build a 1d-CNN

#### Ordering an instance from the image template you built in week02
Access the IBMÂ® Cloud infrastructure [customer portal](https://control.softlayer.com/) by using your unique credentials.
1. Access the Image Templates page by selecting Devices > Manage > Images.

#### Start the Jupyter notebook.

Log in to your VM, and check CUDA is installed.   
```
# On command line
nvidia-smi

Now lets build our docker with the jupyter notebook.  
Once in, start running your notebook and follow the instructions in bold where to fill in code. 
```
docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia -it -p 8888:8888 w251/tensorflow_gpu_lab04:latest
