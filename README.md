# W251 reloaded (Fall 2020)

The revised class is focused on Deep Learning and Big Data at the Edge and in the Cloud.

To follow the class, you'll a Mac or a PC (Windows or Linux) with an ability to run docker or VirtualBox VMs. You will also need additional equipment as follows:
### Required equipment:

We are working on sourcing discount codes for the Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit and hope to have them available the week before classes start. For details on set up see [homework 1](week01/hw): 
 1. [Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit)
 2. MicroSD card (64GB minimum size)
 3. USB MicroSD card reader
 4. NVMe M.2 SSD (256GB minimum size) **NOTE: SATA M.2 SSDs will not work**
 5. Size 0 Philips head screwdriver
 6. Micro USB to USB cable
 7. USB Webcam

### Homeworks:
A homework is due before each class.  There are two types of homeworks: graded and credit only. Here is the link to [class 1](week01) - be sure to complete the setup of your Xavier as described in [homework 1](week01/hw)

### SSH Reminder:
Ensure that any VSI/VM create prohibts login with password prohibited.
See: https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/tree/master/week02/hw/README.md for details.

### Graded homeworks
The graded homeworks are week 3, week 6, week 9, week 11


### Final Projects (due in the final class session of the semester)
 - Form teams of three to four people
 - Leverage big data, cloud, DL, and the edge device to do something cool
 - Should be more than you can do on a workstation
 - To turn in: White paper explaining what you did, how you did it, what you learned, what went right (or wrong) and a brief presentation (10-15 minutes)
 
 An example of a final project:
  - Leverage a dataset of missing persons.
 - Train a model in the cloud to recognize the missing persons.
 - Deploy the model to your edge device.
 - If a person is recognized, send the image and location back to the cloud for further actions.
