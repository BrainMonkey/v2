# Images

These images are build from the NVIDIA nvidia-l4t-tensorflow base images.  Details on the images are availabel at https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:l4t-tensorflow.

We are currently using l4t-tensorflow:r32.4.3-tf1.15-py3 and l4t-tensorflow:r32.4.3-tf2.2-py3, both of which require Jetpack 4.4.
