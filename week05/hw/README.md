# Homework 5: TF2 and TF1

## Introduction to Tensorflow v2
The idea of this homework is to serve as an introduction to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  TensorFlow 2 is based on [Keras](https://keras.io/), which you encountered in Session 4 and (hope you agree after reviewing section 2 of this homework) is much easier to use than Tensorflow 1. 

* Start the tf2 container: `docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -p 8888:8888 -d w251/tensorflow:nx-dp4.4`. Note that our docker image is based on the NGC TF2 image with the addition of jupyter and a few other things.  Take a moment to review and reflect on this [docker file](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/backup/tensorflow/Dockerfile.nx-dp4.4).
* Once the container launches, take note of its uid; use it to get the autogenerated token as follows: `docker logs <container id> 2>&1 | grep token`
* Glance through the [TF2 beginner lab](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner). Download this notebook from the TF hub and upload it to your NX container. Run it to completion.
* If you see errors in the `buffer_size=AUTOTUNE` related cell, just comment out AUTOTUNE and set buffer_size to 32 . As of 2/1/2021, Colab uses TF 2.4 and we only have 2.3 on the Jetson.
* What's the structure of the network that's being used for classification? How good is it? Based on what you learned in homework 4, can you beat it? Hint: use something like [this](https://github.com/dragen1860/TensorFlow-2.x-Tutorials/tree/master/01-TF2.0-Overview) if you need an inspiration.
* Repeat for the [TF2 Quickstart lab](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub). Download / upload to NX and run to completion.
* Remove the pip install instructions, yuo don't need them
* Note: you'll have to make changes to the code and if you encounter the OOM errors.  Hint: what is your batch size?
* Can you improve model accuracy? Hint: are your layers frozen?




### Questions:
