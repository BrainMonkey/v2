# Labs 3: Digits on the Jetson

Digits is an [Open Source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS) project by Nvidia, designed to make it easy to train neural networks.
TBD

## Setting Up the Jetson for DIGITS (Optional)

If you haven't done this already, go to the dire
```
docker build -t caffe -f Dockerfile.caffebase .
```
This assumes that you previously created a docker image called "cudabase" and that it exists locally.
