# Homework 7 - Neural face detection  (please note that this homework is still in development, please don't start it yet)

### Overview
The objective of this homework is simple: in the same processing pipeline that you implemented in 
[homework 3](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week03/hw/README.md), replace the OpenCV-based face detection method with 
a Deep Learning-based one. You could, for instance, rely on what you learned in 
[TensorRT lab 5](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week05/labs/lab_tensorrt.md) or 
[Digits lab 5](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week05/labs/lab_digits.md)

### Hints


### To turn in:

Please provide a copy of the code related to the neural face detector along with access to the locatiom (object storage?) 
containing the detected faeces. Note that this homework is NOT graded, credit / nocredit only
